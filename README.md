# Season Of Glass

_Season of Glass_ is an ongoing work of interactive fiction inspired by the [SCP Foundation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/), [Fallen London](https://www.fallenlondon.com/), [the Magnus Archives](https://rustyquill.com/the-magnus-archives/), [Disco Elysium](https://discoelysium.com/), [House](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24800.House_of_Leaves) of Leaves, and other great, narrative-driven, word-heavy, world-heavy works.  Like many of these works, it has a strong focus on good worldbuilding with a foundation in reality. Like many of these works, its narrative is character-(and player-) driven and it doesn't shy away from choices having world-changing consequences. Like many of these works, it explores what we can do with hypertext and how this impacts perception. _Season of Glass_ doesn't really fit any single genre, but has elements of horror, speculative fiction, urban fantasy, and other.

_Season of Glass_ will have several chapters, each detailing another individual's story. You play an out-of-work reporter who comes to a mysterious town to follow up on a very tenuous lead. While exploring the town and talking to its inhabitants, you live their stories and learn more about the secret at the heart of Ryer's County: the St. Charlotte Institute. Or was it St. Christine? Surely it wasn't St. Chanel. Something like that. 
Decisions you make as the main character, or as one of their interviewees impact the rest of your story in various ways, creating a different story in each path. The goal is to ultimately change the meaning you, the player, derive from the story based on your choices.

## The author 

Hi, I'm Mel. I work in software, and I have a background in linguistics and semiotics. On top of that I constantly have ideas too big for my little static stories to handle, and worlds too detailed for my D&D campaigns to fully explore. _Season of Glass_ is a way for me to get this all out of my system and onto paper. I'm writing this to a soundtrack of synthwave and Nintendo music while three cats compete for my attention.

I'm using Github for versioning and project management, issue tracking, etc. [While you can access the chapters as github pages](https://melsmits.github.io/SeasonOfGlass/), these are work in progress and probably unstable versions. Finished chapters will appear on [Itch.io](https://itch.io) and [ifdb.org](https://ifdb.org)
